Purpose: A person's memory is a very valuable thing and having a good one adds to one's overall life.  Memory is not an inherited thing and it must be practiced in order to keep the mind sharp.  This game was created to give users the chance to practice memorizing in order to add to their overall life.

Instructions: A game that tests the user's ability to recall information.  The user must replicate the randomly generated path in the correct sequence.  The difficulty is increased if the user completes the path.  See how high a level you can get to or compete against your friends!

User Sory:

	The home screen comes up with the instructions

	User selects the number of players 1 or 2

	1 player mode:
	user selects either standard mode or freestyle mode

	standard mode:
	the user starts at level 1 which is a 3X3 grid

	the random path to the end square is shown once the path is complete the countdown begins

	the user will have 10 seconds to memorize the path

	once the countdown hits 0 the game will start and the user must navigate to the end square

	if the user strays from the path or steps on a square out of sequence the user "falls" and goes back to the start square and loses a life

	the user can click the peek button to reveal the path for 1/2 a second.

	if the user get to the end square the user moves on to the next level and the board size is increased by 2 and the user gets an extra peek

	if the user loses all of the lives then the game is over

	Freestyle mode:
	the rules are the same as 1 player mode except the user does not have limit on lives

	the goal is to get to as high a level as possible

	2 player mode:
	the users select the board size from the list

	two boards will appear and the path is shown

	once the countdown gets to 0 the game starts 

	whichever player correctly replicates the path to the end square first wins
