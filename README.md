The home screen comes up with the instructions

User selects the number of players 1 or 2

1 player mode:
user selects either standard mode or freestyle mode

standard mode:
the user starts at level 1 which is a 3X3 grid

the random path to the end square is shown once the path is complete the countdown begins

the user will have 10 seconds to memorize the path

once the countdown hits 0 the game will start and the user must navigate to the end square

if the user strays from the path or steps on a square out of sequence the user "falls" and goes back to the start square and loses a life

the user can click the peek button to reveal the path for 1/2 a second.

if the user get to the end square the user moves on to the next level and the board size is increased by 2 and the user gets an extra peek

if the user loses all of the lives then the game is over

Freestyle mode:
the rules are the same as 1 player mode except the user does not have limit on lives

the goal is to get to as high a level as possible

2 player mode:
the users select the board size from the list

two boards will appear and the path is shown

once the countdown gets to 0 the game starts 

whichever player correctly replicates the path to the end square first wins
